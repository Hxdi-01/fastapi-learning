# Day 10 — Git & GitHub Basics

# Goal:
#     Learn how to use Git to track my code and push it to GitHub.

# Why:
#     - So my code is backed up online.
#     - So I can share my projects with others.
#     - So I can track changes over time (version control).

# What I did:
#     1. Initialized a Git repository in my project folder:
#         git init

#     2. Configured my Git identity (only needed once per computer):
#         git config --global user.name "MyName"
#         git config --global user.email "myemail@example.com"

#     3. Staged my project files for the first commit:
#         git add .

#     4. Committed the staged files with a message:
#         git commit -m "First commit"

#     5. Linked my local repo to my GitHub repository:
#         git remote add origin https://github.com/Hxdi-01/fastapi-learning.git

#     6. Pushed my code to GitHub:
#         git branch -M main
#         git push -u origin main

# Key Vocabulary:
#     Repository (repo) – A project tracked by Git.
#     Commit – A saved snapshot of changes.
#     Push – Upload commits to GitHub.
#     Remote – A link to a repo hosted online.
#     Origin – Default name for the remote.
#     Main – Default primary branch name.

# Result:
#     ✅ My project is now on GitHub at:
#        https://github.com/Hxdi-01/fastapi-learning
