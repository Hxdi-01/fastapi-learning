# ðŸ§  TL;DR â€” Whatâ€™s Happening?
# User makes a request â†’ /agent
# This middleware runs before the route
# logs the method/path
# call_next(request) runs your route function
# Middleware resumes after the route
# logs that the response is ready
# Response is returned to the user

# Imagine this:
# Middleware is like a security guard
# call_next(request) means:
# ðŸ›‚ â€œOkay, this visitor checks out. Let them into the building."
